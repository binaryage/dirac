; bencode transport (default for nREPL) cannot be trusted (as of [org.clojure/tools.nrepl "0.2.12"])
; the list of quirks I've discovered so far:
;   1. encoding booleans throws
;   2. nils are decoded as []

; We work around those by encoding broken values as strings with unicode marker (U+1F4A9) "pile of poo" prepended.
; On the nREPL client side, we detect poo markers and decode strings back to clojure values.

; Anyone observing dirac-related nREPL messages should immediately spot that something smelly is going on...

; Warning! don't get your hands dirty when working with this code!
