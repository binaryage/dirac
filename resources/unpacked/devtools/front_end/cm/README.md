# Rolling CodeMirror

## What's this about?
CodeMirror is a third-party library, which supports editing experience in Chrome DevTools. DevTools does not fork CodeMirror, thus all CodeMirror patches should go upstream to http://codemirror.net.
Every once in a while, the CodeMirror dependency (which is located in Source/devtools/front_end/cm/ folder) should be updated to a newer version.

## Updating CodeMirror

Run `python ./scripts/deps/roll_codemirror.py <codemirror_dir> <devtools_dir>`

## Manual steps
This requires the following steps to be done:
1. File `headlesscodemirror.js` is a `runmode-standalone.js` file from CodeMirror distribution, but wrapped in `(function(window) { ... }(self))`
construction. This is needed to support in web workers.
2. File `codemirror.css` contains both the default theme of CodeMirror and structural css required for it to work. Discard everything in the file up to the word `/* STOP */`.
3. All other files in `front_end/cm/` folder should be substituted with their newer versions from the upstream.

## Testing
DevTools wrap CodeMirror via `CodeMirrorTextEditor.js` and `cmdevtools.css` files.
Although there are a couple of automated tests (web_tests/inspector/editor/) to verify overall sanity of the setup, a manual testing is mandatory before
landing a roll. Here is a rough testing scenario outline:
1. Create a new snippet and type in a small function with a few nested for-loops. (The author suggests a bubble-sort). Make sure that:
   * Words `function`, `for`, `var` are highlighted
   * "Smart braces" behavior works
   * "Enter" after opening curly brace adds correct indent
   * Autocompletion works
   * Multiple cursors functionality works as intended - Ctrl+D/Ctrl+U shortcuts
   * Set a breakpoint inside a function, select some text and summon a context menu over it.
2. Make sure there are items such as "Add to Watch", "Evaluate in Console" and "Copy/Paste"
Make sure minified jquery opens nicely in the editor (minified jquery could be found as a resource on http://jquery.com)
   * Verify `jquery.min.js` is formatted via "Pretty print" action
3. Go to the Elements panel, select a node and verify the "Edit it as HTML" command works.

## Committing
The only changes allowed to `front_end/cm/` folder are CodeMirror rolls. There's a presubmit check that enforces this, so make sure you include the phrase "roll CodeMirror" into
your patch description.
