    `query-action-maps`   - a seq of maps of queries to actions (queries find HTML elements, actions are fn's that act on them)

    Note that a \"query\" that is just a String will be interpreted as the id attribute of your target element.
    Note that an \"action\" that is just a String will be interpreted as a call to `input-text` with that String for the target text field.

    Example usage:
    (quick-fill a-driver
      [{\"first_name\" \"Rich\"}
       {{:class \"foobar\"} click}])")
  (quick-fill-submit

    "Same as `quick-fill`, but expects that the final step in your sequence will submit the form, and therefore clj-webdriver will not return a value (since all page WebElement objects are lost in Selenium-WebDriver's cache after a new page loads)"))
