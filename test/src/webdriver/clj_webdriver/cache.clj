;; ## Element Caching ##
;;
;; Due to how Selenium-WebDriver deals with elements on a page,
;; even if the same element is queried in an identical way,
;; there is no way to test the equivalence of the element. A new
;; object is created every time an element is "discovered" on the page.
;;
;; If you've enabled caching for your Driver and provided a set of cache rules
;; for the cache to abide by, when you call `find-element` or `find-elements`,
;; the cache system makes the following checks:
;;
;;  * Is this `find-element` request on the same page as the previous? If a new page is loaded, the cache is reset anyway.
;;  * Is this `find-element` request already in the cache? If so, return it. If not, find element on page.
;;  * Once element is found, does this element conform to a cache rule? If so, cache it.
;;
;; Cache rules must be based on the query used to acquire the element.
;; The cache rules are defined as a vector of maps that match queries you want
;; to include/exclude.
;;
;; Here are two examples:
;;
;;     {:include [ {:class "foo"}
;;                 {:css "ul.menu a"} ]}
;;
;;     {:exclude [ {:query [:div {:id "content"}, :a {:class "external"}]},
;;                 {:xpath "//h1"}  ]}
;;
;; You may either choose a whitelisting approach with `:include` or a blacklisting
;; approach with `:exclude`, but not both.
;;
;; For the sake of API sanity, if you create a cache rule based on css, xpath,
;; or ancestry-based queries, the match must be exact.
;;
;; Cache rules are evaluated in order, so put most-frequently-used cache rules
;; at the beginning of the vector.
