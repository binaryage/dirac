# This target is used to perform checks on all generated `.d.ts` files.
# Previously we would only run these checks when `is_debug=false`, but
# this complicated debugging. Therefore, this target now always perform
# the check, but we only check the `.d.ts` files once (rather than for
# every single defined `ts_library`).
#
# Whenever a folder is fully checked by the TypeScript compiler, add
# the folder to the `deps` of this target AND add a corresponding
# `import`-statement to the `verification.ts` file. Without adding
# the `import`-statement, TypeScript will be "smart" and ignore all
# declaration files it doesn't have to use.
