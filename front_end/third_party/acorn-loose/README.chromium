Description:
An error-tolerant JavaScript parser written in JavaScript.

This parser will parse any text into an ESTree syntax tree that is a reasonable approximation of what it might mean as a JavaScript program.

It will, to recover from missing brackets, treat whitespace as significant, which has the downside that it might mis-parse a valid but weirdly indented file. It is recommended to always try a parse with the regular acorn parser first, and only fall back to this parser when that one finds syntax errors.
