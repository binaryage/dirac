Description:
Logical assignment support for Acorn.

This is a fork of the upstream at https://github.com/acornjs/acorn-logical-assignment and will be maintained until upstream has merged required changes for ESM support.

While the PR is outstanding, we import the code manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bmeurer/acorn-logical-assignment
cd acorn-logical-assignment
git checkout esm
npm run build
npm pack
# cp acorn-logical-assignment-0.1.1.tgz to this folder
tar xzf acorn-logical-assignment-0.1.1.tgz
```

After the PR is merged, we can download from npm:

```bash
wget -qO- https://registry.npmjs.org/acorn/-/acorn-logical-assignment-0.1.1.tgz | tar xzf -
```

Local modifications:
- Add acorn-local-assignment.mjs.d.ts for typechecking.
