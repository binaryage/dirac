This is a Rust library that is used to parse DWARF from WebAssembly
files and resolve source locations <-> addresses.

It's compiled to Wasm + JS bindings that are used by SDK.WasmSourceMap.

Currently the built artifacts are checked in to the repo to avoid
adding dependency on Rust toolchain for everyone working on the
DevTools frontend code.

To modify and recompile the library, you'll need:
1) Rust toolchain - install as per https://rustup.rs/.
2) Wasm-pack toolchain - install as per https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/.
3) Change code in `src/` folder.
4) Rebuild with `wasm-pack build --target no-modules`.
